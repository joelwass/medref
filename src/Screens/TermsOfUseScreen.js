          The Bedside Acute Care Medication App (BAMA) is intended to be a tool to assist in the medical care of patients and is not a substitute for professional medical care. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the content; however, accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The app is a guide and not a substitute for proper medical training or sound clinical judgment and does not set the standard of care. The content was designed for use by current best medical evidence guidelines available in the United. Drug dosages, treatment algorithms, and general medical practice may vary in other countries. It is the responsibility of the user to confirm the accuracy of all content. The user is advised to consult additional references before making any clinical decisions. Before administration of any drug, it is recommended to review manufacturer’s current product information for accepted indications, dosages, adverse effects, contraindications, and any other information pertinent to appropriate use. The developer assumes no responsibility for any loss, injury, and/or damage to persons or property arising from or related to the use of BAMA.
